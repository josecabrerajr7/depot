<p>Some legends are told Some turn to dust or to gold But you will remember me
Remember me for centuries And just one mistake Is all it will take
We&#39;ll go down in history Remember me for centuries (Hey yeah, oh hey,
hey yeah) Remember me for centuries</p>

<p>Mummified my teenage dreams No, it&#39;s nothing wrong with me The kids are
all wrong The stories are off Heavy metal broke my heart</p>

<p>Come on, come on and let me in The bruises on your thighs like my
fingerprints And this is for tonight I thought that you would feel I never
meant for you to fix yourself</p>

<p>Some legends are told Some turn to dust or to gold But you will remember me
Remember me for centuries And just one mistake Is all it will take
We&#39;ll go down in history Remember me for centuries (Hey yeah, oh hey,
hey yeah) Remember me for centuries</p>

<p>And I can&#39;t stop &#39;til the whole world knows my name &#39;Cause I
was only born inside my dreams Until you die for me, as long as there is a
light My shadow&#39;s over you &#39;cause I am the opposite of amnesia And
you&#39;re a cherry blossom You&#39;re about to bloom You look so pretty,
but you&#39;re gone so soon</p>

<p>Some legends are told Some turn to dust or to gold But you will remember me
Remember me for centuries And just one mistake Is all it will take
We&#39;ll go down in history Remember me for centuries (Hey yeah, oh hey,
hey yeah) Remember me for centuries</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been here forever And here&#39;s the frozen proof I could scream
forever We are the poisoned youth</p>

<p>Some legends are told Some turn to dust or to gold But you will remember me
Remember me for centuries And just one mistake Is all it will take
We&#39;ll go down in history Remember me for centuries (Hey yeah, oh hey,
hey yeah) We&#39;ll go down in history (hey yeah) Remember me for centuries</p>
